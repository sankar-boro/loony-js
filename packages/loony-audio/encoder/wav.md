This function, `encodeWAV`, is converting audio data into a WAV file format, specifically a mono (single-channel) audio WAV file with 16-bit PCM encoding. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's happening:

---

### 1. **Setting up WAV Metadata**

- **WAV File Structure**: WAV files have a specific binary format consisting of a header followed by audio data. The header contains metadata like file type, audio format, sample rate, and data size.

---

### 2. **Parameters**

- `audioBuffer`: The raw audio data as an array (assumed to contain normalized values between -1 and 1).
- `sampleRate`: The number of samples per second (e.g., 44100 Hz for CD quality).

---

### 3. **Initialization**

- **Number of Channels**: The function assumes mono audio (`numChannels = 1`).
- **Sample Bits**: 16 bits per sample (standard PCM encoding).
- **Buffer Creation**:

  ```javascript
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(44 + audioBuffer.length * 2);
  ```

  - `44`: Size of the WAV header.
  - `audioBuffer.length * 2`: Space for 16-bit audio samples (each sample uses 2 bytes).

- **`DataView` Object**: Provides a way to write raw binary data into the buffer:
  ```javascript
  const view = new DataView(buffer);
  ```

---

### 4. **Helper Functions**

- **`writeString`**:
  Writes text strings (like `"RIFF"` and `"WAVE"`) into the binary data as ASCII codes.

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    view.setUint8(offset + i, string.charCodeAt(i));
  }
  ```

- **`writePCM`**:
  Encodes the raw audio buffer into 16-bit PCM format:
  ```javascript
  const sample = Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, buffer[i]));
  view.setInt16(offset + i * 2, sample < 0 ? sample * 0x8000 : sample * 0x7fff, true);
  ```
  - Values are clamped between `-1` and `1` (ensures valid normalization).
  - Values are scaled to a 16-bit signed integer range:
    - Negative samples: `sample * 0x8000`
    - Positive samples: `sample * 0x7FFF`

### 5. **WAV Header**

The WAV header is written in a specific format:

| Field Name      | Byte Offset | Description                                  |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `"RIFF"`        | `0`         | Indicates it's a RIFF file.                  |
| File Size       | `4`         | Total file size minus 8 bytes.               |
| `"WAVE"`        | `8`         | Identifies file as a WAV.                    |
| `"fmt "`        | `12`        | Subchunk for format data.                    |
| Subchunk Size   | `16`        | Length of format data (16 for PCM).          |
| Audio Format    | `20`        | 1 for PCM (uncompressed audio).              |
| Num Channels    | `22`        | Number of audio channels (1 = mono).         |
| Sample Rate     | `24`        | Samples per second (e.g., 44100).            |
| Byte Rate       | `28`        | `sampleRate * numChannels * bytesPerSample`. |
| Block Align     | `32`        | `numChannels * bytesPerSample`.              |
| Bits per Sample | `34`        | Number of bits per sample (e.g., 16).        |
| `"data"`        | `36`        | Subchunk for audio data.                     |
| Data Size       | `40`        | Total size of the audio data.                |

### 6. **PCM Data**

After the header, the raw PCM data is written starting at byte offset 44. The helper function `writePCM` performs this task.

---

### 7. **Return**

The function returns the complete WAV file in an `ArrayBuffer`, which can be used to:

- Save the data as a `.wav` file.
- Send it over a network.
- Play it directly in a browser.

---

### Example Usage:

```javascript
const audioBuffer = [0, 0.5, -0.5, 1, -1]; // Example normalized audio data
const sampleRate = 44100;

const wavData = encodeWAV(audioBuffer, sampleRate);
const blob = new Blob([wavData], { type: 'audio/wav' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const audio = new Audio(url);
audio.play();
```

This example creates a WAV file from raw audio data and plays it.
